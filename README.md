# Ambitions-Goals
My name is Theodore Wen, a high school student. I'm currenctly studying grade 11 computer science at Georges Vanier Secondary School. I'm deeply interested in programming, even though I do not have a lot of experience on programming. It was last year that I first got in touch with programming. However, I believe that I will improve a lot through the studying over time. My ambitions and goals on Computer Science are pretty straight forward, it is that I wish to go into the CS program either in University of Toronto or Waterloo. I wish to learn about all different kinds of programming language, and become relatively knowldgeable. And I believe one day I will be able to develop a pretty decent program of my own.
